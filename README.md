# Hi there! <img src="https://github.com/Andres-G-Gomez/Andres-G-Gomez/blob/main/animated-waving-image-0077.gif" width="30px" height="30px" />

I graduated with a master’s degree in electrical and computer engineering (ECE) from the University of Florida in May 2024. My academic pursuits centered on signal/image processing and machine learning coursework, complemented by research endeavors in computer vision.

I am working with Dr. Catia Silva to build out a personalized, affect-aware multimodal educational assessment tool. This project integrates computer vision and time-series algorithms to advance learning technologies, with a specific focus on leveraging localized facial expressions for enhanced model adaptability and expressiveness. This surpasses previous methodologies, which often classify emotions into a limited set, thereby constraining the model’s flexibility.

Before that project, I worked in [Dr. Wei Shao's](https://nephrology.medicine.ufl.edu/profile/shao-wei-1/) Artificial Intelligence in Medical Image Analysis Laboratory. There, I applied deep learning methods to medical images for segmentation and disease classification purposes. My project centered on refining deep learning techniques for multi-object medical image segmentation. Specifically, I worked on optimizing vision models using methods like image augmentation, layer freezing, and fine tuning to analyze computer tomography and magnetic resonance imaging datasets. I also ran large scale experiments benchmarking recently published models against state-of-the-art medical image segmentation models.

I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others in a way that’s as public as possible. On my [projects page](https://andres-g-gomez.github.io/projects/), you’ll find a collection of tutorials and articles that I’ve written to provide a comprehensive explanation of the intricacies of new segmentation models.
